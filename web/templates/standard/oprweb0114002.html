<b>%OPRWEB01.14.106.002 </b>and I have discussed the present condition
and the various ways in which it may be treated. The doctor has recommended:
<b>%OPRWEB01.14.127 </b>
<p>
<UL>
The doctor has also told me that:-
<LI>an anaesthetic, medicines, and/or blood transfusion may be needed, and these
may have some material risks;
<LI>additional procedurs or treatments may be needed if the doctor finds
something unexpected;
<LI>the procedure may not give the expected reseult, even though the procedure
is carried out with due professional care;
<LI>it may be necessary to use bone from the Bone Bank if it is necessary
to fill defects in the bone during the procedure
<LI>as an additional precaution for both myself and the hospital, blood testing
for both Human Immunodeficiency Virus ("HIV") and Hepatitas prior to my
procedure is recomended. In addition, I understand taht any such test results
will only be used in connection with a bone graft if required and will 
be maintained as confidential; and
<LI>some of the bone, tissue and (in the case of revision surgery) implants
that are removed at the time of surgery and normally discarded may be used
by researchers approved by the Mater Misericordiae Hospital Ethics 
Comittee for the purposes of investigating the cause of success
or failure of joint replacement surgery.
</UL>
<i>* delete as required</i>
<p>
The doctor has informed me of the likely results and material risks
associated with the recommended procedure, particularly the specific 
risks associated with bone transplant.
<p>
I understand that undergoing the procedure carries material risk. I have
had the opportunity to ask questions in relation to the procedure and the 
material risks.I am satisfied with the explanation and the answers to my
questions.
<p>
I consent for the procedure described above *for me/for 
<b>%OPRWEB01.14.002</b>
<p>
I also consent to the administration of anaesthetics, medicines, blood
products and/or other treatments which could be related to this procedure.
<p>
I consent/withhold* consent to blood testing for HIV and Hepatitis.
I consent/withhold* consent to the results of such r5.07ing being entered 
into my clinical record.
<p>
I consent to the use of my usually discarded tissues, bone or implants for the
purpose of medical research.
<p>
If the doctor finds something unexpected during the procedure which is related to theprocedure, I consent to the doctor treating it also.
